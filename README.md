# 📱  React Native  App

This project is a React Native quiz application. It presents multiple-choice questions with a
countdown timer per question. If the time runs out, the app automatically moves to the next question.
Navigation is manual,
using "Next" and "Prev" buttons — answers are not submitted automatically.
